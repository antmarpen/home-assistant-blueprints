| `ac_efficency_and_notify.yaml`      | Notifies a mobile user when the AC is running and a window/door is open, waits for a response, then shuts off the AC (optional follow-up voice alert). | Tested only for android devices, not tested what happens when multiple mobile devices choose different options in their notifications. |
<!-- Add new blueprints here as you publish them -->

## üìÇ Installation

You can add a blueprint to your Home Assistant in one of two ways:

1. **Local copy**  
   - Copy the blueprint YAML file into your configuration, for example:  
     ```
     config/blueprints/automation/<custom_folder>/<blueprint_name>.yaml
     ```
   - In Home Assistant UI go to **Settings ‚Üí Automations & Scenes ‚Üí Blueprints ‚Üí Import Blueprint**, then browse and select the file you just added. e.g
     ```
     <custom_folder>/<blueprint_name>.yaml
     ```

2. **Import by URL**  
   - In Home Assistant UI go to **Settings ‚Üí Automations & Scenes ‚Üí Blueprints ‚Üí Import Blueprint**.  
   - Paste the raw URL of the blueprint file (e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antmarpen/home-assistant-blueprints/refs/heads/main/ac_efficency_and_notify.yaml`) and click **Preview ‚Üí Import**.

Once imported, you can create an automation from the blueprint via **Settings ‚Üí Automations & Scenes ‚Üí Create Automation ‚Üí Use Blueprint**.  


## ‚öôÔ∏è Example of Usage
